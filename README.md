# CorvidShulker

## Overview
CorvidShulker is, well, my poor attempt at a mod, and rn it can kinda do the following stuff (idk how good tho lol):  
- show item name  
- show count  
- show aux value  
- show some block refs (maybe)  
- dump user NBT/extra stuff  

Honestly idk what to do with it next and the reference pics arenâ€™t even worth showing lol
